# Recipe Ordering Simplified (ROS)

This project is designed to assist in stocking up your pantry to enable you to create many meals, converting cups to kg etc. Originally intended for school's Food Science programs it has been adapted for the long term planner / provisioner. <br/>
Over the years it has essentially been a project to continue to hone skills and techniques outside of any work projects. Previously called Provisioners Cookbook.
